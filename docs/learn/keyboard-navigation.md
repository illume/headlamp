# Keyboard Navigation

Headlamp's resource list tables are fully keyboard-accessible. This guide explains how to navigate them without a mouse.

## Navigating Between Rows

When a table is on screen, press **Tab** to move focus into it. The first row is highlighted with a blue outline to show which row is active.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Tab** | Move focus into the table; advance to the next focusable element |
| **Shift+Tab** | Move focus backward |
| **↓ Arrow Down** | Move to the next row |
| **↑ Arrow Up** | Move to the previous row |
| **Home** | Jump to the first row |
| **End** | Jump to the last row |
| **Enter** | Navigate to the resource's detail page |

## Reading Row Data

Table columns have visible header labels. When a row is focused, screen readers announce each cell's content in column order. The focused row is also highlighted visually so sighted keyboard users can see which row is active.

## Accessing Links Inside a Row

Some rows contain multiple links — for example a resource name link and a namespace link. To interact with a specific link:

1. Use **↑/↓** to move focus to the row you want.
2. Press **Tab** to move focus from the row into its first link.
3. Press **Tab** again to advance to the next link or button within that same row.
4. Press **Enter** or **Space** to activate the focused link or button.
5. Press **Shift+Tab** to step back to the previous link or back to the row itself.

## Using the Row Actions Menu

Most resource rows include a **⋮** (More actions) button at the right edge. To open it with the keyboard:

1. Focus the row with **↑/↓** arrow keys.
2. Press **Tab** until the **⋮** button is focused (it appears as the last element in the row).
3. Press **Enter** or **Space** to open the actions menu.
4. Use **↑/↓** to move through menu items.
5. Press **Enter** to select an action, or **Escape** to close the menu without making a change.

## Pagination Controls

After the last row, pressing **Tab** moves focus to the pagination toolbar. You can use the keyboard to change pages or adjust the number of rows displayed.

## Filtering and Searching

The search box above the table is also keyboard-accessible:

1. Press **Tab** to reach the search field.
2. Type to filter the visible rows.
3. Press **Tab** to move back to the table once filtering is done.
